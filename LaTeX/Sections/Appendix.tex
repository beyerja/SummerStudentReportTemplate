\subsection{Potentially interesting details}

For plots, figures and calculation that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item are too detailed for main text
  \item are side remarks
  \item are slightly different versions of plots shown in the main text (but not different enough to need to be there)
  \item coooooouuuuuld be interesting if someone tries to repeat my study...
\end{itemize}
